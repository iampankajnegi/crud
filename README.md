# crud
The CRUD application we'll be building is a simple task management system. Users can create, view, update, and delete tasks using the application. The front-end will be built using React.js, allowing users to interact with the application's interface, while the back-end will use Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to handle data storage and manipulation.
